# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Command Center

A unified **Security Operations & Threat Intelligence platform** designed to simulate real-world SOC workflows by correlating security events, enriching them with threat intelligence, and prioritizing alerts using contextual risk scoring.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Cybersecurity Command Center** demonstrates how modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) detect, analyze, and respond to threats efficiently.  
Instead of flooding analysts with raw alerts, the platform focuses on **signal quality, prioritization, and decision support**.

This project is built as an **academic & research demonstration** aligned with enterprise SOC practices.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Reduce alert fatigue for security analysts  
- Prioritize threats based on risk and context  
- Demonstrate hybrid analysis (logic + intelligence)  
- Simulate real SOC investigation workflows  

---

## 🧠 How the Platform Works

### 1. Event Ingestion
- Authentication events (e.g., SSH failures)
- Network activity (e.g., port scans)
- Simulated and static log sources

### 2. Threat Intelligence Enrichment
- IP reputation context
- External intelligence feeds (simulated)
- Confidence and reputation scoring

### 3. Correlation & Risk Scoring
- Events are correlated across sources
- Risk scores calculated based on:
  - Frequency
  - Reputation
  - Confidence
  - Behavioral indicators

### 4. Analyst-Focused Dashboard
- Prioritized alerts
- Severity classification
- Actionable explanations
- Decision-support oriented layout

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Most security dashboards focus on displaying data.  
**This platform focuses on helping analysts decide.**

- Context-first analysis instead of rule-only detection  
- Intelligence compression into actionable signals  
- Designed to mirror real SOC pressure environments  
- Modular architecture for future expansion
